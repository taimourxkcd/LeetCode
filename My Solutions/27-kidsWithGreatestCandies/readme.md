- if after giving extra candy they have greatest candy then return true else false


# Approch
- find the max candy amoung the kids
- add extra candy to what kids already have
- create ans vector, if kid >= candy then true else false
- return 


# Complexity
- The time complexity O(n)

- The space complexity O(n)
