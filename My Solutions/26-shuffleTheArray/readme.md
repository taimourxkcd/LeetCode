# Problem Statement
Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
# Approch
- we create a new vector
- we have two variables z = 0 and j = 1, every time we increment by 2
- run the loop for n/2


# Complexity
- The time complexity O(n)

- The space complexity O(n)
