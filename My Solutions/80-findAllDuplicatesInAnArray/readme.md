# Problem
- we have to find all the duplicates in an array given that element can occur either 1 or 2 times

# Approch
- put all the elements inside the hashmap with there occurance
- pull all the elements that occur twice in ans vec and return it 

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) 

- Space: O(n)
