# Problem
- given the array find if it is valid palindrome. but only check for numbers and alphabets 

# Approch
- create a new empty string
- loop through it, everytime s[i] is an alphabet or no. concat it into the new string
- once we have the new string, we use the two pointer approch

# Complexity

- Time:  O(n)

- Space: O(n)
