# Problem Statement
- we have two arrays. one with the startTime and other with the endTime. also we are given a queryTime. we have to find the number of students that were 
  studing during that time.

# Approch
- iterate the array and check the condition that if the startTime is >= queryTime and queryTime <= endTime then increase ther count.  

# Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
