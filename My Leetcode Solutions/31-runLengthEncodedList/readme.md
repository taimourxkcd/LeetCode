# Problem
- we are given an array like this nums = [1,2,3,4]
- take two elements at a time.
- first is freq and second is the value
- create a new array with val with there freq

# Approch
-  formula is given: [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]
-  done using the formula self explanatory

# Complexity
- The time complexity O(n)

- The space complexity O(n)
