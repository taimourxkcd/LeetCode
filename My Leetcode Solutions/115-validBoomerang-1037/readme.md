# Problem
- we have to return true if the given points are a boomerang. boomerang is when 3 points don't lie in the same line

# Approch
- just used the formla that tells us if two points lie in a single point or not. 
- (y2 - y1) / (x2-x1) = (y3 -y1) / (x3 - x1)

# Complexity
- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)
