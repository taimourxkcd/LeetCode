# Problem
- we have a string and an array
- array gives us the sequence in which the string elements should be arranged

# Approch
- we start by taking element from 0 .... end in the string
- we set them equal to the indic as given in the array

# Complexity
- The time complexity O(n)

- The space complexity O(n)
