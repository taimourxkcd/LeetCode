# Problem Statement
- given in an aray we have to find the total pairs and then numbers that are left over

# Approch
- create a hash map that stores the freq
- then iterate the map and divide by 2 to get the number of pairs. and to find the leftover elements in the array we take the modulus  

# Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
