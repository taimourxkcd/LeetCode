# Problem Statement
- a robot can move in left right up down direction from origin we have to find if it returns back to origin. 

# Approch
- create two variables vertical and horizontal. 
- horizontal keeps track of movements along the that axis and veritical on that axis.
- at the end if both the horizontal and vertical are 0, we know that it returns. 

# Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
